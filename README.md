#### A Web Application for managing BTS sites and Engineers, Date of current version: June 2019.
#### By **David Mwaniki Njiru**
## Description
This is Week 3 Independent Project learning Java programming using Spark framework.

The purpose of this Independent Project is to demonstrate your level of understanding of the various concepts that you have covered in the content throughout the week.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
The Web App is built on Java Spark. All you need to run is a browser and internet. However, if you have the code locally, it can run on your computer browser.

## Behavior Driven Development(BDD)
Before writing this code, I focused first on the behaviours that I would want to see in our final application. I considered what the program should do, thought through possible scenarios when the user would encounter when interacting with the application.

The Site Maintenance Manager should be able to add a list of the maintenance engineers, and for each engineer, add the sites that the engineer maintains. The engineers work independently, so each site only belongs to a single engineer.
